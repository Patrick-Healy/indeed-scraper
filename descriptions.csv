Control computer system(s) on schedule by means of computer system console, operator checklists, and third-party software
Scheduling flexibility required
Must have availability outside of normal hours and on weekends as required for on-call coverage and extended systems maintenance and upgrades
Knowledge and Experience
Excellent communication skills

                Job Req ID: 380 - Amaysim Australia Ltd - Victoria

What's it about?
amaysim are looking for an expert. Someone who knows Orion Billing back to front, but also has a deep understanding of the retail energy market. Are you our newest Orion Billing Support Analyst?

Role Responsibilities
The Orion Billing Support Analyst is responsible for the Orion application and associated interfaces and tools. Your main responsibility is to ensure the Orion based services meet business requirements including stable and secure operation, and timely on-boarding and billing of Click Energy customers.
You’ll flex your expertise daily, from delivering changes to Orion (discovery, design, build, test, release), work with a variety of amaysim teams to ensure sister platforms are functioning and integrating as required, to general system maintenance or the Orion configuration.

Who we are looking for?
You’re a levelheaded problem solver, able to cut through to the heart of an issue and think of multiple angles of attack. You’re organised, yet able to pick up work on the fly. You’re collaborative but willing to take the lead on incidents.You’re looking for a company to make a difference, where you’re able to affect real change and have your ideas heard.This role is ideal for someone who wants to grow their technical and backend capabilities on Orion, after spending a 3+ years working as a Billing Analyst or similar billing support position. This role probably wouldn't be ideal for someone who is already a capable BA, as we're looking to help someone develop down a BA path.
To be a success in this position you’ll need:
A profound understanding and demonstrated experienced in the operational support of Orion Billing system, or similar energy customer billing systems - be it operationally or technically.
Experience and knowledge of the energy industry.
Experience in supporting critical production systems and prioritisation of issues.
An understanding and exposure of business or systems analysis to scope, design and manage changes to systems.
Excellent interpersonal, written and verbal communication skills coupled with exceptional organisational and planning skills.
Experience working with others to resolve IT incidents.
Knowledge of MS SQL Server databases and queries would be an advantage, but not a requirement.What's in it for you?
You'll get the chance to work in an environment that has an enormous appetite for change; a place that truly values and fosters the innovation you can bring to the teams you work with. We try to be as lean as we can, avoiding red tape and bureaucracy. We do our best to maintain the 'startup' look and feel, but without the constraints and overheads usually associated with less well-established organisations.
We're small enough that your voice will be heard loud and clear, and your (excellent) ideas and innovations will be championed and rapidly adopted. And we're large enough that we can execute on these ideas at scale and your work will be used by hundreds of thousands of (happy) customers.
But wait, there's more. As well as being an awesome place to innovate, drive change and make a difference, amaysim also tries to be a place that keeps you excited to come in on a Monday morning through all kinds of fun extras, including:
an amaysim phone plan and discounted energy plan (what else??)
an extra day of annual leave on your birthdayjoin the annual company on Culture Days to discuss and shape how the company is run
a thriving social life, with events happening most months
brand new office, at the Paris end of Collins Streetand much, much more...
Recruitment process and onboarding
Due to current travel restrictions and social distancing measures, our interview process will be via video. If selected, onboarding will also take place remotely, where you’ll be provided with a laptop and a tailored onboarding experience. More information will be provided throughout the process.

Who we are
We used to be a telco, but we’re now so much more.
If working in empowered teams, delivering amazing experiences, and being surrounded by like-minded people in an inspiring culture is what you're craving, then look no further. #buzzwordbingo
We value our four principles of reliability, simplicity, agility and empathy above all else.
We believe it’s how we live these values that set us apart and inspires us to make amazing experiences for our customers every day.
It doesn’t matter if you’re a customer on our award-winning mobile plans or have switched to our hassle-free home energy plans, we believe every Aussie deserves a fair deal and a great customer experience. Simple.

                We’re seeking out a driven Business Analyst to play a key role in our fast-paced digital product development team! We’re not going to lie - it’s not an easy gig - there is a huge amount of responsibility and impact for this role - but for the right candidate, it will be the best role you’ve ever had! ;)

The software we build (and there is a lot!) is used by millions of customers, so this role has a huge impact. The team you will be a key member of is fast-paced, independent, ambitious and proficient across the full tech stack. They’ll challenge your assumptions and proposed solutions, and push you to better solve problems or define solutions.

If you’re looking for a regular 9-5 office job then we’re not for you. We’re looking for ambitious people prepared to do whatever is required to get the right solution live for our customers and built efficiently - advocating for the best customer experience on Kogan.com.
In order to join the team, you’ll be:A problem solver with an analytical mindset, even better, if you have experience with business, data, customer (or even financial-type) analysis! We are looking for exceptional logic and analytical skills over limiting our reach to people only in software development.
Someone with excellent communication skills, ideally experienced in ‘managing’ stakeholders, project management and gathering requirements from the business to achieve the desired outcome(s). You’ll both learn about, present and optimise business goals to our tech team in order for the right technology to be built, efficiently.
Someone with great attention to detail, whilst being able to manage multiple priorities and lots of context switching - you will thrive on knowing everything from the broader business objective(s) to the edge cases.
Experience with software development is a plus, but if you do, we want you to care about the full SDLC and not just writing BRD’s! You’ll love working alongside our developers and designers to advocate for the business, customer and technology objectives.
Someone who is accountable, organised, upbeat, super motivated and experimental. We want our business analysts to be passionate about building amazing software and technology solutions for our millions of customers - whether that be new functionality on the sites we build and maintain, integrations with third parties or performance optimisations to keep everything running super smoothly for our customers!
What you’ll do:
You will be working within our core engineering team to service both our internal stakeholders and most importantly, our customers. To do this, your role on the team will be to:
Be the ‘front door’ of our tech team - working with our site and customer data, stakeholders, partners and customers to agree, document and prioritise future and in-flight technology changes.
Break down ambitious business goals into smaller technology deliverables that our software engineers can iteratively push through to production;
Understand and document acceptance criteria, facilitating scope management, quality and timeliness as a requirement makes it way through the entire software delivery lifecycle;
Drive the focus on shipping to production as quickly as possible, using data to identify, escalate and improve delivery bottlenecks to ensure our software delivery lifecycle flows efficiently; and
Understand and document estimated and actual business value delivered to provide insights into future improvements.
Understand how to organise your workload and break down your time to focus on tasks and get outcomes delivered daily

                Bring data to life through use of insight tools and your creative storytelling ability!
Gather, analyse and distribute media intelligence and competitor analyses
12 month fixed-term contract role
Client

One of the nation’s most influential media organisations who reach millions of Australians. News and sports brands, fashion, food, health, real estate and parenting.

This role sits within a specialist unit that develops communications solutions which are bespoke to client needs (i.e. not off-the-shelf). As each campaign is custom built, the solutions may be a combination of content, conversations and experiences using all media assets.

What’s the role?

We’re seeking a creative Insight Analyst to join our innovative team. You will play a pivotal role supporting the sales team by generating high level audience, brand and category insights to create compelling stories for bespoke client solutions. You will access syndicated research databases, trend reports, news articles and your own desk research, and distill the relevant facts into meaningful and thought-provoking insights.

You’ll be required to:
Provide outcome focussed, market ready insights and consult with Strategy Managers to ensure the solutions we create for clients are built upon those insights.
Build strong relationships with sales teams and partner with them to identify market opportunities and research needs analysis.
Take ownership of proactively starting conversations, which result in direct revenue outcomes, based
on your findings from research and trends analysis.
Liaise with best-in-class external research companies to implement campaign measurement solutions.
Provide regular and timely competitive and category media reports and research analysis through syndicated advertising expenditure data, specialist industry reports and available research data.
Who you are

You’re an analytical thinker who balances your exceptional attention to detail with your ability to articulate the bigger picture. Prior experience within an Insight or Strategy role will be seen as advantageous. You might be from a research background but you’re not a run of the mill ‘data-nerd’, as you’ll be keen to unleash your creativity as much as crunching any numbers. Or perhaps you’ve come from a strategist role and you’re most passionate about the research that fuels your thinking.

Importantly you’ll have strong communication and presentation skills in addition to being a talented storyteller who can disseminate insights to suit your audience. You are a team player who understands the importance analytics plays in the wider sales arena and you bring a genuine enthusiasm that inspires others. It’ll be an added bonus if you’ve had exposure to media measurement tools, however this isn’t a deal-breaker.

What’s next?

This is a 12 month fixed-term contract role based in the Melbourne office. If you’re known for your balanced approach to being data-driven and communicating for impact, then we want to hear from you! To apply email word resumes to daniel@goldmangarnier.com.au
